Welcome to KaggleBot, a command-line tool designed to utilize LLM's to use Kaggle API.

## Features

- Interactive command-line interface.
- Stream processing of user inputs.
- Verbose mode for detailed event state debugging.

## Purpose and Limitations

This project is a demonstration and does not fully implement all endpoints from the official Kaggle API. It is intended to showcase the basic interaction and handling of user queries. For comprehensive functionality, refer to the official [Kaggle API documentation](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api).

## Run

You need to run configure.py file first to change settings.

```
python configure.py -m <model_name> -k <api_key> -p <model_provider>
```
